# Restaraunt-Management-System

The Restaurant Management System is a dynamic project that revolves around creating an efficient and well-organized database using MySQL. The database structure encompasses crucial entities such as Bookings, CustomerDetails, Orders, Staff_Information, and Menu. This meticulous design ensures seamless data management, fostering data integrity and facilitating quick and precise information retrieval.

To enhance functionality and minimize redundant code, the project incorporates stored procedures and prepared statements. Examples include the CancelOrder procedure for swift deletion of specific order records and the implementation of the GetMaxQuantity prepared statement to easily check maximum order quantities. These features contribute to a streamlined and optimized database experience.

Beyond database management, the project delves into insightful data analysis and visualization. Utilizing SQL queries, the system identifies customers with sales surpassing $70 and pinpoints popular menu items with more than two orders. These analyses provide actionable insights into customer preferences and menu performance. Visualizations, including customer sales trends and cuisine-specific metrics, offer a clear and intuitive representation of critical business data.

A noteworthy aspect of the project is the integration of a Python environment, adding a layer of accessibility to the database. Python scripts seamlessly connect to the MySQL database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve data. This integration not only enhances the versatility of the system but also provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with and explore restaurant-related data.

In summary, the Restaurant Management System project showcases a holistic approach to database design, optimization, and integration. By combining these elements with advanced data analysis techniques and Python integration, the system provides a comprehensive solution for managing restaurant data efficiently and extracting valuable insights.
